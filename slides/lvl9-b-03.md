### Demo: Set up an Angular project

    # Install the generator globally
    npm install -g generator-angular

    # Make a new directory, and cd into it
    mkdir my-new-project && cd $_

    #Run yo angular, optionally passing an app name:
    yo angular [app-name]

    #Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview
